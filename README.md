## Come visit us in the Tixati channels!

Drop in and say hi to us. We're a pretty friendly bunch :)  The [Tixati User Group - Help and Support](dsc:cqtrmrfvac3nta3ndtoo3n2trq6wxa6aef7bleragj4evcjvcscq?dn=Tixati%20User%20Group%20-%20Help%20and%20Support) channel is a good place to start. Remember that sometimes there can be a delay in response time (we're busy people from many different timezones) so don't leave right away. Relax, browse some of the thousands of shares, see if you find something interesting and someone will respond eventually.
